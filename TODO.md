## TODO:

1. Create "factory" class, simple and stupid as possible that allows us to create ingredients.
2. Create ingredients stash, or some container designed to keep them. First: for herb example
3. Create tool to process the herbs (**note: Keep in mind decision if we need tools factory or if tools should be added by hardcoding**)
4. Create basic **product**
5. Create **procedure** to create **product**
6. Add some processor or **workbench** that will get the stuff: **procedure**, **tool**, **ingredients (in stash)** and will create **product**
